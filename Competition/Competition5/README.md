Use <a href="https://quickdraw.withgoogle.com/data"><strong>Quick, Draw! dataset</strong></a> as training data 
and <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/magenta/tree/master/magenta/models/sketch_rnn">sketch-rnn</a> as training model. 
Our goal is to train a generator that can make the sketch look like class that your model want to draw. 
In this competiton, we use "<strong>hot air balloon</strong>", "<strong>bulb</strong>", 
"<strong>ice cream</strong>", "<strong>microphone</strong>" as classes to draw.</p>
